						For my ideation & prototyping class, we had to create either a dystopia or utopia, and create a soultion to a problem that would occur. My dystopia focused on extreme enviornnmental pollution, specifically air pollution, so I designed an apartment building that was not only carbon-neutral, but it put oxygen back into the air inn various ways. Additionally, the buildig was completely self-sufficient in terms of energy.
						I presented my building in the form of a streeteasy ad, as well as a brochure that you would receive as soon as you move in.

						For my final project, I want to make a website for this building. The format for the floor plan page will be the same for all of the other pages, except for the home page.
