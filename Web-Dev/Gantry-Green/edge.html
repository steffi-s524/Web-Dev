      <p style="font-family: 'Roboto'; font-size: 20px; color: #FFFFFF;">At Gantry Green, the beloved LIC vibe meets modern luxury and the newest environmentally-conscious technology in a neo-industrial building on Fiftieth Avenue, just steps from the East River Waterfront. Conceived by Steffanie Schron, these 85 boutique Hunters Point luxury apartments are nestled in one of New York’s most desirable neighborhoods.
From the rooftop deck to the corners of each individual studio, one, two, and three bedroom apartment, upscale details and the latest in eco-technology, all of which grace every apartment, abound, to create an eclectic urban living environment you’ll be proud to call home while having little to no negative impact on the environment. In fact, Gantry Green is the first building ofits kind to actually have a positive impact on the environment:the building itself is modeled after the veinns of leaves, taking in carbonn dioxide and emitting oxygen. Floor-to-ceiling windows generate solar energy, and white oak cabinetry & flooring takes in the carbon dioxide you emit, and puts out oxygen for you to breathe. Sleek, black floor tiles absorb your body heat, and convert it to thermal heat to warm the all rooms. Energy-star certified appliances use the most efficient methods for high performance, from bidets that recycle water to wash your hands to ovens whose metal absorbs your body heat, and thermal energy goes towards heating your food.
Community areas are carefully furnished and arranged to facilitate socializing as well as privacy. Bicycle storage, in-home washers and dryers, and a fitness center bring another measure of convenience to residential life, as well as a childcare center and a greenhouse that residents can purchase food from, or grow their own.
The rooftop deck offers peak relaxation with beautiful views of the city. And as a pet-friendly community, your dogs and cats are welcome to join you here. This is elevated boutique living in the heart of Hunters Point, and you’re invited to experience it. Contact us and take the next step toward calling it your home by booking a virtual tour.
