				<p> For my midterm, I am making a website for NYU's Breakdance Club, of which I am on the eboard. I want it to be simple, yet edgy at the same time. I am planing on including the club's logo, as well as promotional video I made a while back. It will talk about what we do in the club, when we meet, contact information, and (hopefully), the Zoom link for the meetings.
