      <h1>Vannevar Bush Reading:</h1>
      <p>
          I thought that the article was very interesting. I was very surprised that, for being written in 1945, Vannevar was already dreaming of today’s technologies that are so commonplace, such as computers and headphones. What was more astonishing was how optimistically Bush spoke of these things, because we, the people who use these things all the time, have so much to complain about them, whether it be the quality of the objects, or whether they have any purpose. I found it interesting how he so much champions these technologies to improve knowledge, when, now, it seems as if so much technology is made just to turn a profit, and not actually improve anything.

      <h1>Tim Berners-Lee Reading:</h1>
      <p>
          I thought that the article was very interesting. I was very surprised that, for being written sixty-five years after the Vannevar article, we had the technology that Vannevar dreamed about, and we were already trying to look past it. What was more astonishing was how optimistically Berners-Lee Bush spoke of these things, to the point that he seemed to echo Bush’s sentiments, because he too wants these technologies to be more than just about money and power. He wants technology, especially the interet, to actually help improve things, and be a pillar of freedom.
