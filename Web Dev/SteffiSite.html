What I thought about the John Berger video:
<p> While it was not the first time that I saw this film, I did find it interesting in some aspects. It reinforced just how much technology has evolved, and how it easy is, especially through sharing images, to communicate with the rest of the world. I thought he also did a very good job explaining how ads used images to convince us that buy things we may not necessarily need. However, I did not like how John Berger mentioed that "men dream of women, women dream about themselves being dreamt about, men look at women, women watch themselves being looked at". I felt that sentiment was quite shallow on Berger's behalf, because have hearts and minds that care about things that are more important, and, frankly, more interesting, than our looks. Additionally, we look good because we want to make ourselves feel good, not to impress men. It's effort being a female, so to hear Berger reduce women to solely being the objects of men was quite insulting. It shows how gendered his "way of seeing" is.
